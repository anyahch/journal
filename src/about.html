    <h1>About this site</h1>
    <p>The details about the site.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I created it on 9/2/23, after the idea had arisen on 31/8/23.</li>
        <li><span>I will be updating it </span><span>every day</span><span> I will be coding</span> (the middle span can be used separately to both of the side spans).</li>
        <li>It is a side project - for practice, not for portfolio (designed at forst to be so).</li>
        <li>I made it using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> on <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to pass by, as this is purely personal with little value for anyone else. However, if someone struggles to find motivation, you can randomly scroll through it to see what pther people do on their daily coding practice.</p>
