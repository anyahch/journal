Today I copied files from Glitch to the repository. Some of them are unclear to me, like templates (.njk). On glitch there were .json files as well, but I left them there because I don't yet understand what they mean.

Before that I practiced the box model of TOP - uderstood better the difference and usage of block and inline attributes(?).

Understand I have a lot of things to learn to be able to create a website on my own. I need to go through tutorials on YouTube to learn how to use Eleventy. [Here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wD00RT6d-g&list=PLwhCq3ZFGOGgZDg_pnVh15gUfYqWnlWRs&index=1)

I used Obsidian last summer, so md is familiar to me, cool.

I feel like I'm being unproductive. So I need to make this blog worthy to show to the potential clients/employers as well as people I know. I will try my best not to make therapy out of it.

At the end of coding session I practice some concepts on JS in codecademy mobile app.
