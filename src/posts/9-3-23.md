Tried installing nodejs and eleventy but got into big trouble that I cannot solve. I'm in despair. Cannot follow a simple tutorial and cannot explain the problem. The problem is that npm start cannot run a website on external server. I coudn't find the solution on the net. Next time I will post the problem on stack. Why not now? Maybe it will resolve as I look at it from the fresh start. Cannot lauch a blog in the form of a site yet.

Did 3 lessons on JS in codecademy. 4 to go. Covered errors and currying (nested functions).
